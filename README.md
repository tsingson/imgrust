# imgrust a rust http server for image upload only

Â 

Run with `cargo run`. This starts a server at http://localhost:8080 with two routes:

* `POST /upload` - you can upload a images here
* `GET /images/*` - static 

Example upload request:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/upload' \
--header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
--form 'file=@/home/somewhere/picture.png'
```

The file is saved using a random id as a name, with the extension. The name is logged, so you can see that it worked.

The max file-size is configured at ~5 MB.
